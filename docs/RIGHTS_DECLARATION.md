TL;DR: I made this and I am okay with you guys relicensing this later as long as it's still open source.

By making a contribution to this project, I certify that:

 Ⅰ) This contribution is made entirely by myself, or in a way that
 gives me full rights to the contribution.

 Ⅱ) I realize and understand this contribution will be permanently recorded
 under this repository alongside the information attached to it (Such as my Github username)

 Ⅲ) I give full rights to Hypr Development to redistribute this contribution as a part of the parent project in both source and binary form.

 Ⅳ) I give full rights to Hypr Development to relicense the parent project to which I am contributing at a later date to any license as long as that license does not hinder the ability of one to contribute to, or view the source code of the project.

 Ⅴ) I understand this document may change in the future, although any contributions made will be subject to the version at the time of the submission.
